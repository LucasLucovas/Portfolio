        <h3>Hello it's a pleasure,I'm Lucas</h3>
        <p>I'm a FrontEnd developer from Argentina, Córdoba.
           Specialized in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, React.js, MaterialUI, and Bootstrap. 
           As a frontend web developer, I take pride in crafting elegantly simple solutions that are not only visually appealing but also responsive. 
           I am passionate about creating well-designed, user-friendly interfaces. 
           I am dedicated to continuous learning and aspire to expand my skills into mobile development. 
           In my free time, I enjoy walking, going to the gym, and playing with my cat, Apolo.</p>
